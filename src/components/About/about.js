					<br />
					I love to understand how things work, solving problems and taking on new challenges. <br />
					<br />The feeling of completing new projects from scartch brings opportunities for growth and adds
					to my accomplishments as a software engineer.<br />
					<br /> When am not building websites and apps, you'll find me hiking, playing the piano and spending
					time with my family. <br />
					<br />Currently looking for my next opportunity. Feel free to contact me.
